# Multi player reflex game.

This project uses the firebase, for `multiplayer game in real time` :). <br />
[DEMO here](https://gra-reflex.firebaseapp.com/#/) <br />
Mechanism for game is simple. I focused more on correct game play, redirections, bug fixes, etc.

### What's inside?
* Login panel
* Character selection
* Validation
* Current score and play for players in real time!
* Instruction
* Redirections, routing
* Error checking mechanism, like remove player(drop DB) at the right time 
* Reacts to the back button or F5
* 2 special containers: `NotFound` and `GameDisconnect`
* Score board (in the future)

### Under construction
- Own select box with avatars
- Maybe add fetch() and .json
- Regular expressions for validation
- Score board

### Installation and configuration

1. Install Node.js -> [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install all dependencies `npm install`
3. Run `npm run start` to start a server and begin developing
4. Run `npm run build` to create a build

## Built of ...

* React
* Webpack
* Sass
* React Router
* Firebase
* HTML, JS, and other..

## Further idea for development

I will add consistent layout and better colors. Possibility to choose theme for user.
Score board. And more a little details :). <br />

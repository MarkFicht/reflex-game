## Further idea for development

I will add consistent layout and better colors. Music in background. Possibility to choose theme for user.
Score board. And more a little details :). <br />
For mechanism in JS, fix all bugs, like problems with 1 or 3 users in database. Redirections problems, etc.<br />
Implementation of the target mechanism game, where player must perform the appropriate click sequences.

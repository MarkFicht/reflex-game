# Multi player reflex game.

This project uses the firebase, for multiplayer game in real time. <br />
[DEMO here](https://gra-reflex.firebaseapp.com/#/) <br />
Mechanism for game is in BETA, working only X button without displaying the sequence

### What's inside?
* Login panel
* Validation
* Current score for players in real time
* Character selection
* Instruction on full size
* Redirections, routing
* Drop database, after gameover
* Score board (in the future)

### Under construction
- Divide main component on components
- Drop player from game after disconnect / leaving
- Score board

### Installation and configuration

1. Install Node.js -> [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Install all dependencies `npm install`
3. Run `npm run start` to start a server and begin developing
4. Run `npm run build` to create a build

## Built of ...

* React
* Webpack
* Sass
* React Router
* Firebase
* HTML, JS

## Further idea for development

I will add consistent layout and better colors. Music in background. Possibility to choose theme for user.
Score board. And more a little details :). <br />
For mechanism in JS, fix all bugs, like problems with 1 or 3 users in database. Redirections problems, etc.<br />
Implementation of the target mechanism game, where player must perform the appropriate click sequences.
